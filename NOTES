- What should be the relative weights for optimizating axial vs. azimuthal slope errors?
  Or does it even make sense to ask that question.

1 or 2%  Sin graze angle.

- Maybe optimizing displacements is equivalent?   Investigate whether the RMS slope error
  is the same for different optimizations.

- If we were doing this in the lab, what data would we have?

Set of axial profiles (manufacturing, etc errors) basically legendre polynomials.

ideally 1k x 1k (azim and axial) sampling in 200mm x 400mm mirror

400-600 pts in axial strips 
initially more, eventually no more than 1 strip / mm
